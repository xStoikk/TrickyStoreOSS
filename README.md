# Tricky Store OSS

*A trick of Keystore they forgot to hide.*

A fully open-source, FOSS alternative to the proprietary [TrickyStore](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore) Magisk module.

---

## Why this exists

TrickyStore's author has a track record of [violations and questionable practices](docs/5ec1cff-violations.md)

So this is a complete rewrite from scratch, built on:

- The projects credited in [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)
- Official changelogs and the expected behavior of newer releases
- Original fixes and features carried over from an earlier fork of the old codebase

Licensed under **GPLv3** and it stays that way.

---

## Features

- 100% FOSS, no closed-source components
- Matches the proprietary implementation's behavior and feature set as closely as possible

## Requirements

- Android 10+

---

## Installation

1. Flash the module and reboot
2. *(Optional)* Place an unrevoked hardware keybox at `/data/adb/tricky_store/keybox.xml` for extended integrity
3. *(Optional)* Customize target packages in `/data/adb/tricky_store/target.txt`
4. *(Optional)* Customize the security patch level in `/data/adb/tricky_store/security_patch.txt`

All config files take effect immediately — no reboot needed after step 1.

---

## Configuration

### `keybox.xml`

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<AndroidAttestation>
    <NumberOfKeyboxes>1</NumberOfKeyboxes>
    <Keybox DeviceID="...">
        <Key algorithm="ecdsa|rsa">
            <PrivateKey format="pem">
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
            </PrivateKey>
            <CertificateChain>
                <NumberOfCertificates>...</NumberOfCertificates>
                <Certificate format="pem">
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
                </Certificate>
                <!-- more certificates -->
            </CertificateChain>
        </Key>
    </Keybox>
</AndroidAttestation>
```

### `target.txt` — mode selection

Tricky Store OSS intercepts attestation-related keystore calls for listed packages. **Automatic mode never silently substitutes software attestation** — it forwards to the real keystore and preserves the genuine result or error.

Override per package with a suffix:

| Suffix | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| *(none)* | **AUTO** — real keystore forward; no silent software attestation |
| `?` | Explicit hybrid re-sign (`HYBRID_RE_SIGNED`) |
| `!` | Explicit software-synthetic (`SOFTWARE_SYNTHETIC`) |

On a device where the TEE probe reports **BROKEN**, plain AUTO still attempts the real hardware keystore and propagates the genuine success or failure. Use `!` only when you explicitly want software-synthetic attestation. Synthetic mode does **not** provide Google hardware-attestation trust.

**Shared UID:** Android may assign multiple packages to one UID. TrickyStore aggregates `target.txt` modes at **UID scope** (Binder exposes UID, not package). If any shared package uses `!` or `?`, the whole UID is treated as explicit-capable — not plain AUTO. See [docs/target.txt.md](docs/target.txt.md).

```
# target.txt
com.google.android.gsf              # automatic (real keystore)
io.github.vvb2060.keyattestation?   # explicit hybrid re-sign
com.google.android.gms!             # explicit software-synthetic
```

### `security_patch.txt`

Optional. Lives at `/data/adb/tricky_store/security_patch.txt`. It sets the three patch levels a spoofed attestation reports: `osPatchLevel` (system), `vendorPatchLevel`, and `bootPatchLevel`. It only changes KeyAttestation output, not system properties. Changes apply on save, so no reboot is needed.

Lines starting with `#` are comments, and blank lines are ignored.

#### Global and per-package

Settings above a package header are considered global and is the default for every app. A package header (`[package.name]`) on its own line targets one app; everything below it applies only to that app until the next header. This lets you give different apps different dates, for example an old system date for `com.google.android.gms` and a recent one everywhere else.

A package inherits anything it does not set from the global block. For example: `[com.google.android.gms]` block that sets only `system=` still picks up the global `vendor=` and `boot=`.

#### Keys and dates

The keys are `system`, `vendor`, `boot`, and `all`. `all` sets all three at once and any single key overrides it.

Dates can be written as `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYYMMDD`, or `YYYYMM`. `YYYY`, `MM`, and `DD` work as placeholders for the current year, month, and day; they resolve on every attestation, so `YYYY-MM-05` always lands on the 5th of the current month.

#### Special keywords

- `no` omits that patch level tag entirely. The attestation reports nothing for it.
- `device_default` keeps the device's real value for that component.
- `prop` mirrors the system security-patch prop (`ro.build.version.security_patch`). It is kept for backward compatibility; `device_default` is the more accurate name for new configs.

#### Examples

Simple form, one date for all three levels:

```
20241101
```

Per partition:

```
# system patch level
system=202411
# report nothing for boot
boot=no
# vendor, alternate date format
vendor=2024-11-01
# keep the device's real boot level instead
# boot=device_default
```

Per-package overrides:

```
# global default for every app
system=YYYY-MM-05
vendor=device_default
boot=no

# GMS needs the old print date for a legacy <A13 STRONG verdict
[com.google.android.gms]
system=2024-10-01

# a demo app with its own set
[org.app.demo]
all=2025-09-15
boot=device_default
```

GMS overrides only `system`; it inherits `vendor=device_default` and `boot=no` from the global block. The demo app sets all three to `2025-09-15` via `all`, then carves boot back out to the real device value.

> This only affects KeyAttestation results. `resetprop` can be used separately if you need to change system properties.
